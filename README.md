# How to add device into zigbe2mqtt

# Work modes
By default remote works as custom swith, with multiple clicks, this behaiviout has own drawback.
In order to detect multiple clicks, remote sends commands with 300ms delay.
You can change this behaviour by cost of double/tripple/etc clicks. 
To do that you need to change

`ZCL_CLUSTER_ID_GEN_ON_OFF_SWITCH_CONFIG` cluster `ATTRID_ON_OFF_SWITCH_TYPE` attribute

Values are:

`ON_OFF_SWITCH_TYPE_MOMENTARY` (0) -> no delay, but no multiple clicks, only single

`mosquitto_pub -t "zigbee2mqtt/FN/BUTTON_NUM/set/switch_type" -m '0'`

`ON_OFF_SWITCH_TYPE_MULTIFUNCTION` (2) -> 300ms delay, full set of clicks

`mosquitto_pub -t "zigbee2mqtt/FN/BUTTON_NUM/set/switch_type" -m '2'` (default)


# ONOFF cluster binding
By default command is TOGGLE, but you can change this behaviour

Change `ZCL_CLUSTER_ID_GEN_ON_OFF_SWITCH_CONFIG` clusters attribute `ATTRID_ON_OFF_SWITCH_ACTIONS`

`ON_OFF_SWITCH_ACTIONS_ON`

`mosquitto_pub -t "zigbee2mqtt/FN/BUTTON_NUM/set/switch_actions" -m '0'`

`ON_OFF_SWITCH_ACTIONS_OFF`

`mosquitto_pub -t "zigbee2mqtt/FN/BUTTON_NUM/set/switch_actions" -m '1'`

`ON_OFF_SWITCH_ACTIONS_TOGGLE` (default value)

`mosquitto_pub -t "zigbee2mqtt/FN/BUTTON_NUM/set/switch_actions" -m '2'`
